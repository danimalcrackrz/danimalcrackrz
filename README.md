Welcome to my Page

✌🏽 Pronouns: He/Him

I began my career in Tech at 16, fixing iPhone screens and have been hooked ever since. I spent years working in Break/Fix and Technical Support, eventually leading to a role as the sole Backup Engineer at a medicial MSP. Even though I'd made it, I found myself continuously going back to development in my spare time. I've always been fascinated with coding, since the days of MySpace where I would make and customize themes for friends. I decided to pursue my passions for development and transition to a professional developer in 2016.

💪🏽 I'm strongest in:
• React
• HTML/CSS
• NodeJS
• PostgreSQL

🤓 I'm currently learning:
• NextJS
• Python
• Testing
• GraphQL

🤯 Things about me:
• Huge Lego Afficianado! Lets build something cool!
• I taught myself to solve a Rubiks cube on a whim in about 4 days.
• I've met Mariah Carey twice, and both times she called me Handsome 💅🏽
